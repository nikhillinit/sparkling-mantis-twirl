## 📚 TOPIC 1: Present Value and Time Value of Money

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
After this module, you will:
- Calculate PV and FV for any cash flow scenario
- Apply TVM concepts to real investment decisions
- Use Excel's financial functions efficiently
- Solve complex multi-period problems

### 🧠 Core Concepts

**Time Value of Money (TVM)**: Money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to:
1. **Opportunity Cost**: Can invest and earn returns
2. **Inflation**: Purchasing power erosion
3. **Risk**: Future receipts uncertain

### 📐 Essential Formulas

**Present Value:**
$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}$$

**Future Value:**
$$FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n$$

Where:
- PV = Present Value
- FV = Future Value  
- r = Discount/Interest rate per period
- n = Number of periods

### 💡 Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Mixing annual and monthly rates
- ❌ Forgetting to match time periods
- ❌ Using nominal vs. real rates incorrectly

### 🔧 Excel Implementation
```excel
=PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv], [type])
=FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])
```

### 📝 Worked Examples

**Example 1: Basic PV Calculation**
Find the present value of $5,000 received in 3 years at 6% annual rate.

*Solution:*
$$PV = \frac{5,000}{(1.06)^3} = \frac{5,000}{1.191} = \$4,198.10$$

**Example 2: Multiple Cash Flows**
Calculate PV of: $1,000 (Year 1), $2,000 (Year 2), $3,000 (Year 3) at 8%

*Solution:*
$$PV = \frac{1,000}{1.08} + \frac{2,000}{(1.08)^2} + \frac{3,000}{(1.08)^3}$$
$$PV = 925.93 + 1,714.68 + 2,381.50 = \$5,022.11$$

### 🎯 Practice Problems

1. **Quick Drill**: What is the PV of $1,000 in 2 years at 5%?
2. **Application**: A bond pays $50 annually for 10 years plus $1,000 at maturity. Value at 4%?
3. **Excel Challenge**: Compare monthly vs. annual compounding on $10,000 at 12% for 5 years

## 📚 TOPIC 2: Portfolio Expected Return and Risk

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Calculate portfolio expected returns
- Measure portfolio risk (variance/standard deviation)
- Understand diversification benefits
- Apply modern portfolio theory

### 📐 Essential Formulas

**Portfolio Expected Return:**
$$E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \times E(R_i)$$

**Two-Asset Portfolio Variance:**
$$\sigma_p^2 = w_1^2\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1w_2\rho_{12}\sigma_1\sigma_2$$

### 📝 Worked Examples

**Example 1: Expected Return**
Portfolio: 60% Stock A (E(R)=12%), 40% Stock B (E(R)=8%)

*Solution:*
$$E(R_p) = 0.6(12\%) + 0.4(8\%) = 10.4\%$$

**Example 2: Portfolio Risk**
σ_A = 20%, σ_B = 15%, ρ = 0.3, weights 50/50

*Solution:*
$$\sigma_p^2 = (0.5)^2(0.2)^2 + (0.5)^2(0.15)^2 + 2(0.5)(0.5)(0.3)(0.2)(0.15)$$
$$\sigma_p = 14.23\%$$

$$HPR = \frac{P_1 - P_0 + D}{P_0}$$

**Bond Price:**
$$P = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1+y)^t} + \frac{F}{(1+y)^n}$$
